NOTES ON POSSIBLE DATA USE 

In Nigeria LSMS-ISA, the FIES module was administered twice – once in post-planting visit (July 2019-September 2019), and once in post-harvest (January 2019-February 2020). 

Same as the FIES module include in the phone survey, the module had a reference period of last 30 days, and a reference population of adult household members. 

There are 4 samples for which FIES estimates could be derived from pre-COVID-19 Nigeria LSMS-ISA dataset, identified by the variable sample:

1.	Harvest Full – Entire Nigeria LSMS-ISA sample that received FIES module in the post-harvest visit

2.	Harvest Post-COVID – Portion of the Nigeria LSMS-ISA sample that received the FIES module in post-harvest visit and that were also interviewed by the phone survey (in Round 1)

3.	Planting Full – Entire Nigeria LSMS-ISA sample that received FIES module in the post-planting visit

4.	Planting Post-COVID – Portion of the Nigeria LSMS-ISA sample that received the FIES module in post-planting visit and that were also interviewed by the phone survey (in Round 1)

To compare pre- vs. post-COVID-levels and in view of the data collection period, use Planting pre-COVID sample. 
For weights, use a common weight for pre- and post-COVID FIES variable and take the popweight_adult included.
